it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife

however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters

my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that
netherfield park is let at last

mr bennet replied that he had not

but it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and she
told me all about it

mr bennet made no answer

do you not want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently

you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it

this was invitation enough

why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he
is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to
be in the house by the end of next week

what is his name

bingley

is he married or single

oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or
five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls

how so how can it affect them

my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them

is that his design in settling here

design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he
may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes

i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send
them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are
as handsome as any of them mr bingley may like you the best of the
party

my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but
i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now when a woman has five
grownup daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty

in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of

but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood

it is more than i engage for i assure you

but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to
go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no
newcomers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to
visit him if you do not

you are overscrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very
glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy

i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the
others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so
goodhumoured as lydia but you are always giving her the preference

they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters

mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you
take delight in vexing me you have no compassion for my poor nerves

you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they
are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration
these last twenty years at least

ah you do not know what i suffer

but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood

it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them

depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them
all

mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour
reserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character her mind
was less difficult to develop she was a woman of mean understanding
little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented
she fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her
daughters married its solace was visiting and news
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he
had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring
his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following
manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he
suddenly addressed her with

i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy

we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother
resentfully since we are not to visit

but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the
assemblies and that mrs long promised to introduce him

i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces
of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion
of her

no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you

mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain
herself began scolding one of her daughters

don't keep coughing so kitty for heaven's sake have a little
compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces

kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times
them ill

i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully when is
your next ball to be lizzy

tomorrow fortnight

aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back
till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him
for she will not know him herself

then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce
mr bingley to her

impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him
myself how can you be so teasing

i honour your circumspection a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all
mrs long and her neices must stand their chance and therefore as
she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will
take it on myself

the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsense
nonsense

what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he do
you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on
them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you
mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read
great books and make extracts

mary wished to say something sensible but knew not how

while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr
bingley

i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife

i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me that before if
i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called
on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we
cannot escape the acquaintance now

the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy
was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while

how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should
persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a
good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a
word about it till now

now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr bennet and
as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife

what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was
shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness
or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so
pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day but
for your sakes we would do anything lydia my love though you are
the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next
ball

oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the
youngest i'm the tallest

the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return mr bennet's visit and determining when they should ask him to
dinner
